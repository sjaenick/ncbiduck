postprocess bidirectional unfiltered referenceseeker output

needs a combined score CS: (QR ANI + QR Con. DNA + RQ ANI + RQ Con. DNA)/4
    any better ideas here? OS suggests geometric mean

sql db:
    (taxid, parent_id, name, cutoff)
    initialize cutoff at max_combined_score

I. database building:

for all assemblies in genbank:
    get correct tax. lineage for assembly
    obtain refseeker result
    for line in result:
        compute CS
        determine tax. lineage of hit
        filter lineage based on cutoffs in sql db (how?)
        for wrong_node in filtered_lineage:
            reduce cutoff in sql db to (CS-0.001)


II. bin classification:

obtain refseeker result
hits = map<taxon, int>
for line in result:
    compute CS
    determine tax. lineage
    filter lineage based on cutoffs in sql db
    for taxon in filtered_lineage:
        hits.put(taxon, hits.get(taxon) + 1)

besthit = None
bestsum = 0
for tax, score in hits:
    sum = 0
    t = tax
    while t != tax_root:
        sum += hits.get(t)
        t = t.parent
    if sum > bestsum:
        besthit = tax
        bestsum = sum

print lineage for besthit
